          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            I am the youngest of 10 children, and I am grateful that I come from
            a large family. All of my siblings were able to help my parents take
            care of me as a child, this is especially important because I was
            born without many important bones, tendons, and ligaments in my
            right leg and foot. I needed a great deal of care through out all of
            my surgeries. Life has not been easy, but I have learned to be
            persistent, determined, strong, and patient because of the
            limitations I have.
            <br />
            I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,
            and my beliefs sit at the core of who I am. I have learned how to
            rely on Jesus Christ and my loved ones through out my life. I know
            that I cannot do everything by myself and need to ask for help
            sometimes.
            <br />
            Some of the things I love most in this world are my family, my
            friends, Jesus Christ and His gospel, my dog Jett, and any kind of
            digital entertainment (movies, tv, and music). I enjoy learning new
            things from those around me and being able to teach others the
            knowledge I have as well.
