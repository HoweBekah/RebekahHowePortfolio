        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          I am the youngest of 10 children, and I am grateful that I come from a
          large family. All of my siblings were able to help my parents take
          care of me as a child. This is especially important because I was born
          without many important bones, tendons, and ligaments of my right leg
          and foot, and I needed a great deal of care through out all of my
          surgeries. Life has not been easy, but I have learned to be
          persistent, strong, and patient because of the limitations I have.
          <br />
          I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and
          my beliefs sit at the core of who I am.
